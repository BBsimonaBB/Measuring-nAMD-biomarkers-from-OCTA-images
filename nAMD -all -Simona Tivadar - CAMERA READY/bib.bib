ABSTRACT = {The era of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized our daily lives and AI has become a powerful force that is gradually transforming the field of medicine. Ophthalmology sits at the forefront of this transformation thanks to the effortless acquisition of an abundance of imaging modalities. There has been tremendous work in the field of AI for retinal diseases, with age-related macular degeneration being at the top of the most studied conditions. The purpose of the current systematic review was to identify and evaluate, in terms of strengths and limitations, the articles that apply AI to optical coherence tomography (OCT) images in order to predict the future evolution of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) during its natural history and after treatment in terms of OCT morphological structure and visual function. After a thorough search through seven databases up to 1 January 2022 using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, 1800 records were identified. After screening, 48 articles were selected for full-text retrieval and 19 articles were finally included. From these 19 articles, 4 articles concentrated on predicting the anti-VEGF requirement in neovascular AMD (nAMD), 4 articles focused on predicting anti-VEGF efficacy in nAMD patients, 3 articles predicted the conversion from early or intermediate AMD (iAMD) to nAMD, 1 article predicted the conversion from iAMD to geographic atrophy (GA), 1 article predicted the conversion from iAMD to both nAMD and GA, 3 articles predicted the future growth of GA and 3 articles predicted the future outcome for visual acuity (VA) after anti-VEGF treatment in nAMD patients. Since using AI methods to predict future changes in AMD is only in its initial phase, a systematic review provides the opportunity of setting the context of previous work in this area and can present a starting point for future research.},
